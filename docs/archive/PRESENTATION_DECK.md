## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

### Title:
2.3 Trillion Dollars: The AR Reconciliation Challenge

### Content:

Every company selling on credit has an AR team matching bank deposits to invoices.

The Problem: This work requires judgment, not just pattern matching.

Real Examples AR Analysts Face Daily:

1. Freight Deduction Detective Work
   Customer sends 29,250 but invoice was 29,500
   Is this legitimate freight, damaged goods, or unauthorized short pay?
   Answer: 15 minutes of manual research

2. SWIFT Name Truncation
   Bank shows "GREENFIELD TECH SOLUT" (35 character limit)
   Actual customer is "Greenfield Technology Solutions LLC"
   Someone looks it up manually every time

3. Factoring Relationships
   Payment from "ACE Capital Partners"
   Your customer is "Riverside Manufacturing"
   ACE factored the invoice. Routing decision needed.

4. Legal Holds
   Payment arrives for disputed invoice
   Posting violates compliance
   Must escalate to legal, don't process

### Design Notes:
- Use bullet points
- Include icons or small graphics if possible
- Keep text readable (minimum 18pt)

---

## SLIDE 3: THE FINANCIAL IMPACT

### Title:
Why This Matters: Business Impact

### Content:

2.3 Trillion Dollars
Annual AR processed across US companies

1.4 Million Dollars Per Day
Working capital trapped for every DSO increase (for a 500M company)

8 to 10 Edge Cases Per Hour
What an experienced AR analyst can handle

35 Edge Cases in 60 Seconds
What our system handles

Key Insight:
AR reconciliation is not a bottleneck because of missing technology.
It is a bottleneck because it requires business judgment.

### Design Notes:
- Use large numbers with good contrast
- Consider a simple chart showing analyst throughput vs system throughput
- Emphasize the financial impact visually

---

## SLIDE 4: OUR SOLUTION

### Title:
5 Specialized AI Agents on Microsoft Azure

### Content:

Instead of one AI trying to do everything, we built 5 specialists:

Agent 1: Bank Statement Intelligence (15 seconds)
Reads transactions, normalizes names, parses remittance text

Agent 2: AR Ledger Builder (20 seconds)
Builds lookup tables, identifies aliases, flags disputes

Agent 3: Reconciliation Engine (35 seconds)
Tries 8 matching strategies, executes Python for math verification

Agent 4: Mismatch Reasoning (15 seconds)
Uses reasoning model to analyze exceptions
Business judgment: deduction or fraud? Route where?

Agent 5: Cash Posting (10 seconds)
Generates GL routing, creates workqueue, assigns SLA

Total Pipeline: 90 seconds

### Design Notes:
- Use a flow diagram showing agents in sequence
- Color code each agent differently
- Show timing for each agent
- Arrows showing data flow between agents

---

## SLIDE 5: WHY THIS ARCHITECTURE

### Title:
Sequential Hand-Off: Not Parallel Swarm

### Content:

Why Sequential?
Agent 3 cannot start until Agents 1 and 2 finish.
Dependencies are real, not design choices.
This creates a clean, auditable chain.

Right Model for Right Task:
Agents 1 and 2: GPT-4o-mini (fast, cheap)
Agent 3: GPT-4o (complex logic)
Agent 4: GPT-5 (reasoning on exceptions)
Agent 5: GPT-4o (structured output)

Cost Savings:
60 percent less expensive than running everything on GPT-4o

Why Not Third-Party Frameworks?
Built custom orchestrator for:
- Real-time SSE streaming to browser
- Immutable audit trail (finance requirement)
- Model routing without code changes

### Design Notes:
- Use comparison tables if possible
- Show cost savings with a graph
- Highlight the audit trail requirement

---

## SLIDE 6: MICROSOFT AZURE PLATFORM

### Title:
Built Entirely on Microsoft Azure

### Content:

Azure OpenAI Service
Models run in your tenant, not shared infrastructure
Your data never leaves your subscription
Microsoft does not use it to train future models

AsyncAzureOpenAI
Python async client for streaming
Real-time tokens to browser

Azure Blob Storage
Immutable audit trail storage
7-year retention ready

Azure Identity
No API keys in code
Service Principal authentication
Automatic credential rotation

Azure Monitor and OpenTelemetry
End-to-end tracing
Token counts and latency visible

Key Advantage:
Data isolation in Azure tenant = Enterprise compliance ready

### Design Notes:
- Use Azure service icons
- Highlight data isolation as key differentiator
- Show security checkmarks

---

## SLIDE 7: LIVE DEMO RESULTS

### Title:
What the System Produces: Real Results

### Content:

Input: 35 Bank Transactions + 38 Open Invoices
Processing Time: 90 Seconds
Output: Complete Reconciliation with Audit Trail

Results:

32 of 35 Transactions Matched Cleanly (91 percent)
Status: Auto-Post to GL
AR analyst touch needed: Zero

3 Exceptions with Reasoning (9 percent)

TXN-7: Factoring Relationship
Amount: 50,000
Issue: Name mismatch ACE Capital vs Riverside Mfg
Reasoning: ACE is known factor, invoice legitimately assigned
Routing: Route to Riverside Mfg account
SLA: Same day

TXN-15: OFAC Hold
Amount: 35,000
Issue: Payer name on sanctions list
Reasoning: Compliance screening triggered hold
Routing: Escalate to Legal
SLA: Next business day

TXN-23: Legal Hold
Amount: 45,000
Issue: Short pay on disputed invoice
Reasoning: Invoice in active legal dispute, posting violates compliance
Routing: Escalate to Legal
SLA: Legal determines

### Design Notes:
- Use a table for exception details
- Show the before/after: 6 hours manual → 60 seconds automated
- Highlight the 91 percent auto-post rate

## SLIDE 8: HANDLING 35 EDGE CASE PATTERNS

### Title:
Domain Expertise: 35 Real-World Edge Cases

### Content:

Amount Mismatches (8 cases)
Short pay, freight deduction, damage claim, multi-invoice bundle, discount, credit memo, wire fee, overpayment

Identity Issues (4 cases)
SWIFT truncation, DBA name, post-acquisition name, fuzzy matching

Multi-Entity Payments (4 cases)
Parent paying subsidiary, factoring, intercompany netting, wrong entity

Timing Problems (6 cases)
Duplicate, partial, NSF return, stale check, post-dated, prepayment

Remittance Issues (5 cases)
No remittance, vague remittance, PO only, legacy invoice, EDI pending

FX and International (2 cases)
FX conversion, rate verification

Compliance and Legal (3 cases)
OFAC hold, disputed invoice, legal hold

Other (3 cases)
Customer-specific rules

Key Insight:
Most AR systems fail on edge cases.
Our agents try multiple approaches, reason about exceptions, route intelligently.

### Design Notes:
- Use a grid or checklist format
- Highlight the variety of patterns handled
- Show that this is domain expertise, not generic AI

## PRESENTATION GUIDELINES

### Timing:
Total presentation: 3 to 5 minutes
Slides 1-2: Problem statement (45 seconds)
Slides 3-5: Solution and architecture (90 seconds)
Slides 6-8: Proof and domain expertise (90 seconds)
Slides 9-10: Roadmap and call to action (45 seconds)

### Speaking Points for Each Slide:

Slide 1: 30 seconds
"This is Uniquely. We automate accounts receivable reconciliation using AI agents. We process real-world edge-case patterns with OpenAI GPT-5.6."

Slide 2: 45 seconds
"Every company selling on credit matches bank deposits to invoices. The problem is that this requires judgment. Show the four examples: freight deductions, name truncation, factoring, legal holds. These are not one-time edge cases. Finance teams see these patterns constantly."

Slide 3: 30 seconds
"The scale matters. 2.3 trillion dollars in AR annually. 1.4 million per day per DSO increase. Our system handles 35 edge cases in 60 seconds where an analyst handles 8 to 10 per hour. That is the impact."

Slide 4: 45 seconds
"Instead of one big AI, we built 5 specialists. Each does one job. Agent 1 normalizes the bank data. Agent 2 builds the invoice index. Agent 3 runs 8 matching strategies and verifies the math with Python code. Agent 4 uses a reasoning model to figure out why exceptions happened. Agent 5 generates posting instructions. Sequential hand-off, not parallel swarm."

Slide 5: 45 seconds
"Why this approach? Agent 3 cannot start until Agents 1 and 2 finish. Real dependencies. This creates a clean audit trail. We route models by task: GPT-4o-mini for simple work, GPT-4o for complex logic, GPT-5 for reasoning. Saves 60 percent cost. And we built a custom orchestrator, not a third-party framework, because we need real-time streaming and immutable audit logs. That is a finance requirement."

Slide 6: 40 seconds
"Everything runs on Microsoft Azure. Azure OpenAI Service, not public OpenAI. AsyncAzureOpenAI for streaming. Azure Blob Storage for the audit trail. Azure Identity for credentials. Your financial data stays in your tenant. Never touches shared infrastructure. Microsoft does not use it to train future models. For finance, this is non-negotiable."

Slide 7: 45 seconds
"Here is what the system produces. 35 transactions. 90 seconds. 32 matched automatically. 3 exceptions with full reasoning. One is a factoring relationship. We detected that ACE Capital is a known factor. Route to the right customer. One is an OFAC hit. Compliance hold, escalate to legal. One is a disputed invoice. Legal hold. Every decision is reasoned and auditable."

Slide 8: 30 seconds
"We handle 35 specific edge case patterns. Amount mismatches, identity issues, multi-entity payments, timing problems, remittance issues, FX conversions, compliance blocks. Not generic AI. Domain expertise."

Slide 9: 45 seconds
"Phase 1 is now. Proof of concept. Phase 2 is three months. PDF ingestion, async queue, pilot customers. Phase 3 is year one. Enterprise scale, 50-plus customers, 1 million transactions per month, ERP connectors. And Microsoft integration: Day 1 as a Copilot plugin for Dynamics 365. Month 3 as a template in Copilot Studio. Year 1 as a commercial product on the Marketplace."

Slide 10: 45 seconds
"This is a partnership opportunity. We are not asking for funding to build a demo. We are asking for partnership to commercialize something you can sell to every enterprise finance customer using Dynamics 365. 2.3 trillion in annual AR. This is a 100 million dollar opportunity. Live demo is at the URL. Code is on GitHub. Let us go build this together."
